- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SomnuekM
  I have an experience in computer programming. I am proficient in JavaScript, NodeJS, pgSQL, PHP, HTML, CSS. Writing a program has allowed me to develop both problem solving and program designing skills. I have good interpersonal skills and I am highly responsible and enthusiastic about learning new things.
